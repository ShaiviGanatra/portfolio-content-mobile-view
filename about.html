			<h1>ABOUT</h1>
			<hr>
			<p>
				I am a Graduate Student and a Research Assistant studying Human Computer Interaction at University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.
				"I believe that curiosity and desire are the keys to gain insights in life."
				Curiosity towards connection of art, technology, creativity and desire to implement those thoughts into reality drives me each morning to grow more.
			</p>

			<p>
				I did my undergrad in Computer Engineering where I learnt various tools, applications, internal systems, coding and important CS concepts.
				But something that always fascinated me more was the design and the reason why that code is being written.
				Hence, here I am, an amazing designer with a developer perspective.
